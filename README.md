# Changelog Component
## Goal
In this project I was required to create a simple component for a website that displays a changelog. A changelog is a log or record of all notable changes made to a project or software. It is often used to keep users informed about the latest updates and improvements.

## Unique Changelog Component Project

I wanted to take a creative approach to this project and make it stand out. Instead of simply recreating the project as described in the [original project instructions](https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component), I chose to do something distinctive.

I built a version of the original changelog from the website that inspired this project. To make it even more authentic, I added the exact favicon and title as the website [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh). You can check out their original changelog here: [roadmap.sh/changelog](https://roadmap.sh/changelog).

This approach allowed me to not only practice my technical skills but also pay homage to the source of my inspiration while adding a personal touch. I hope you find it as unique and engaging as I envisioned!
